**WARN: (ENCSYT-709):	The next major release of EDI (11.1) will use the
Multi-Mode/Multi-Corner (MMMC) architecture exclusively for configuration and
control of some software features. The current configuration will continue to
work in this release. But for compatibility with the future releases you
should migrate your design to an MMMC style configuration. You can refer to
the What's New document for this release for additional information on the
11.1 migration to MMMC. In addition, you can run loadConfig with the
-showEolWarnings option to identify specific command and configuration
options that will no longer be supported.

**WARN: (ENCEXT-3496):	Options '-best/-worst/-typical' specified in 'rda_Input(ui_captbl_file)' of configuration file for 'readCapTable' are obsolete. For single mode two corner analysis and optimization, use MMMC setup instead of reading multiple captables through command 'readCapTable'. The obsolete options still works in this release, but to avoid this warning and to ensure compatibility with future releases, update your script and configuration file to use MMMC.
